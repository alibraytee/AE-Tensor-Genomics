## Catalogue
## Datasets

#### Original Datasets

Containing the omics data before matching with the clinical

#### Data preprocessing

Containing the omics data after matching with the clinical as well as the related code

#### Breast/Glioma dataserts after feature extraction

Containging the omics data after compressing by each related autoencoder models.

Train set: generated by the saved trained autoencoder models(trained by training data), input: train set

Test set: generated by the saved trained autoencoder models(trained by training data), input: test set

#### Cp decomposed results sets

Containing the optimal results from CP decomposition

## Architecture and codes.
#### Autoencoder Models

Containing the architecture of autoencoder models for each single omics

p.s. AE model for mirna is migrated in one jupyter notebook located in the Autoencoder models/Breast

#### Tensor Analysis

Containing the process of migrating compressed omics data from different autoencoders and different omics

#### Code for Suvival Analysis

Containing the experiment of different clustering methods for suvival analysis

#### Classification on TP of breast

Containg the experiment and code for the classification on tumor purity from breast data.

## Results

#### Suvival analysis results
