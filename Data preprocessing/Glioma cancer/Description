SCNV has the smallest number of dimensions. Hence, the dimensions of SCNV have been extended to 128, 256 and 512. 
The new datasets of SCNV technique with 128 dimensions, 256 dimensions and 512 dimensions have been uploaded to the file to usd for the building and training of AE models. 
Only the best of AE models built on the specific SCNV data will be kept.
The extension of dimensions focuses on the imputation of zero values to reduce the affect of the new values at the most level.
